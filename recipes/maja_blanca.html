        <p>Maja Blanca is a Filipino dessert made from coconut milk, cornstarch, and sugar. Often called Coconut
            Pudding, this luscious dessert is easy to make and the ingredients are very common.Unknown to many, the
            original Maja Blanca Recipe does not include corn and milk. In this recipe, I added whole sweet kernel corn
            and condensed milk for added taste and a more creamy texture.Since Christmas season is just around the
            corner, this would make a very good holiday dessert especially during potluck Christmas Parties and Noche
            Buena as well.</p>
