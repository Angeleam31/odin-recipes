    <p>Dinuguan at puto is considered as a good meal combination for most Filipinos. This refers to pork blood stew and steamed rice cake. The pork is sauteed in garlic and onions. Water, vinegar, and pork blood are added and then cooked until it becomes nice and thick. It is best eaten by dipping (or scooping) the blood stew using steamed rice cake (or what is called puto in Filipino) and eating both together.</p>
