    <p>Filipino pork menudo traditionally consists of chunks of pork that is stewed in a tomato sauce. Liver and potatoes are added afterwards while vegetables like bell peppers, green peas, carrots, raisins and chickpeas may also be added. Some versions of menudo could even have chorizo, ham or hotdog for a richer flavor.</p>
