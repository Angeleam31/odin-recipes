    <p>Chicken Adobo is a Filipino dish made by braising chicken legs (thighs and/or drumsticks) in a sauce made up of vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, and black pepper. It's tangy, salty, garlicy, slightly sweet, and spicy. The chicken is slowly simmered in the sauce making it flavorful and incredibly tender.</p>
